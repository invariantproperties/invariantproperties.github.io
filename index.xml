      <title>The Return Of The Blog!</title>

      <description>This blog was originally located on a self-hosted WordPress instance but I decided to shut it down because I had shifted nearly all of my blogging to my employer&amp;rsquo;s internal blog and I felt I couldn&amp;rsquo;t commit to the time required to keep my self-hosted instance secure.
I had soft plans to bring it back up briefly to capture a static mirror of the contents but never got around to it.</description>
